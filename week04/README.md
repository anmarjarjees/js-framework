# Week04 In-Class Code:
Notice that the code files (examples) of this week (4) are taken from my GitHub repo ["Start with Node"](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start). We covered the first part (index1 - index5) of that repo in this week. The rest (index6 - till the end) will covered in tne next week.

It's strongly recommended to read/review the [README.MD](https://github.com/anmarjarjees/node.js-start) file of "Starting withNode" repo.
